simplified version of wechat chatting data processing

A reaaaaaaaly simple data parsing and processing program. Just for fun haha.

I had a local copy of wechat record data (around 2017) from my old iphone.
I guess wechat is not allowing export of chatting data now.

TODO: 

1. Actually I have text, excel and html formats (this one is txt version). 
Probably will do some other thing in future. :)

2. This excludes around 150 friends' records, due to some file reading error.
probably will look into this problem in future.
